## Introduction

The earliest life of Frideswide in the Worcester Legendary 

This life of St Frideswide (*BHL* 3162), anonymous in its manuscripts, is thought to have been written by Robert of Cricklade [@blairSaintFrideswideReconsidered1987, p. 80]. He was prior of St Frideswide's in Oxford, a house of Augustinian canons -- now Christ Church -- from 1138/39 until his death between 1174 and 1180. Archaeological studies show a major expansion effort begun during his time. He tells in a letter to Benedict of Peterborough how his leg, swollen for many years, was healed after a visit to the shrine of Thomas Becket in 1171/72 [@robertsonMiraculaSanctiThomae1875, chaps. 2.51--52; @magnussonThomasSagaErkibyskups1875, chap. 111]. The cult of St Frideswide flourished soon afterwards, culminating in a festive translation in 1180 and a series of miracles documented by Prior Philip, Robert's successor [@dunningFrideswidePrioryCentre2018]. Likely part of the effort to establish Frideswide as a major saint, the present text is an update to another life of Frideswide written earlier in the twelfth century [translated in @blairSaintFrideswidePatron2004]. This translation is made from an edition by John Blair [@blairSaintFrideswideReconsidered1987, pp. 101--116].

## Authorship

<!--Prior Philip -->

<!--Robert of Cricklade -->

Blair particularly notes stylistic similarities with Robert's *De connubio Iacob* [@blairSaintFrideswideReconsidered1987, pp. 80--81]. One striking feature is Robert's playful questioning of Frideswide at §16, which has several parallels in his corpus, notably in his mock-interrogation of Peter Lombard in *Speculum fidei* 3.4 (Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS. 380, fols. 60v--61r):

> Te alloquor heresiarcha Petre. unde tibi manauit hoc uenenum˷ quod in auribus tibi similium instillasti? Dicis enim. 'Cristus secundum quod est homo⹎ non est aliquid.' O ceruix dura. O cor incrassatum. intelligisne quid dicis? Nequaquam credo. Quia si intelligeres. non diceres. Si supradictas sanctorum sentencias legisses⹎ non diceres. Ergo respondeas queso. Alloquor enim discipulos tuos⹎ uice tua. Iam enim in examine districti iudicis credo te esse⹎ pro hac et aliis heresibus tuis. Respondeas inquam. ut interim omittam querere de distiuncula hac˷ uidelicet secundum. Quid est Cristus secundum quod deus est? Estne aliquid? Quid musitas? Quid taces? Si dixeris non est aliquid⹎ non tantum litterati. sed etiam laici te lapidibus obruent.

> I am speaking to you, arch-heretic Peter: from where did this poison flow to you, which you have poured into ears of people like you? For you say, 'Christ, insofar as he is as is man, is not anything.'

<!--dating -->

Possibly arguing against Robert's authorship is the lack of any self-referential statements. His lives of St Thomas Becket and St Magnus are both identified through internal references to a Master Robert, with his own correspondence included in the former. His *De connubio Iacob* and *Speculum fidei* also have explicit references to himself in the prologue and elsewhere.

## Sources

<!--rel. to Life A -->


<!-- Manner of adapting sources -->


<!--This version, which Blair calls Latin Life A, seems to have been composed for monastic reading and includes a number of authentic-sounding details about Frideswide and her historical context. Latin Life B is essentially a revised and elaborated version of Latin Life A, probably composed between 1140 and 1170 by Robert of Cricklade, a scholarly Austin canon who was prior of St. Frideswide's, Oxford, while the canons were attempting to revive the saint's cult. Prior Robert, who obviously knew more about Oxford and its surroundings than the author of Latin Life A, improves the narrative's references to local geography and traditions and also adapts it to a new audience by omitting some of the details about monastic life, placing more emphasis on Frideswide's dedication to the ideals of poverty and virginity, and paying more attention to the roles played by parents and by the recipients of the saint's miracles. -->


## Manuscripts

Robert's *Vita* survives in three complete sources and two adaptations. The most accurate witness is one of these: five excerpts from the work in Peter of Cornwall's *Liber reuelationum,* Lambeth, Palace Library, MS. 51 (*R*). The surviving manuscripts are Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS. Laud Misc. 114 (*M*), from the twelfth century; Gotha, Forschungsbibliothek, MS. Memb. I 81 (*G*), from the fourteenth; and Cambridge, Gonville and Caius College, MS. 129/67 (*C*), from the thirteenth, whose last leaf is damaged. A 1672 publication preserves an abridged copy once at Fontenelle Abbey (*F*). There is also a record of an untraced copy at Osney Abbey in Oxford.

Although points of ambiguity remain, these sources enable a sound reconstruction of the archetype (ω). In cases of ambiguity, Blair assumed that a variant supported by the Worcester Legendary (*N*) was correct, and I have followed him in this, though these variants mostly occur in *C* and it is possible that they reflect a revision. Collation of witnesses' texts shows that *M* and *G* share a number of significant common errors:

- ω
     - *R*
     - α
         - *M*
         - *G*
     - *C*
     - *F*

The brevity and accuracy of *R* does not suggest a clear relationship with the other manuscripts. It lacks errors that *M* and *G* share.

Blair conjectured a hyparchetype for *M* and *G* [@blairSaintFrideswideReconsidered1987, p. 102]. The addition of *R* and *F* to this edition, along with improved knowledge from the *Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources*, help to confirm this analysis. *M* and *G* share several significant errors where *C* has a demonstrably correct reading: 'gemitibus' for 'genibus', §10; 'solicitudine' for 'sollicite', §15; 'quantas' for 'quantitatem' and 'fore' for 'forte', §18; 'tuis' for 'suis', §19. There are further examples of likely shared errors between *M* and *G* where the correct reading is not definitive. Only three readings suggest a different filiation, and reasonable explanations are available in each case. At §3, I interpret both *G* and *C* as lacking 'quippe' (present in both *M* and *F*, which Blair did not observe); two scribes might independently skip this, as the next word is 'quinquennio'. At §8, *M* and *C* both read 'consentire' for 'consenti' (*G*) where an imperative is necessary; the preceding 'utere' could have prompted the error. At §12, *G* and *C* both read 'eos' for 'eas' (referring to Frideswide and her companions). At §17, the archetype likely read 'hec indicaretur species' (*M* and *C* before correction), with *G* offering a tidy solution, 'hec indicaret species'. One of the correctors to *C* also sees the problem and proposes 'hoc indicaretur specie'. As a result of this demonstrable relationship, it is possible to identify some variants from the archetype on the basis of the stemma.

Most of the variants in *F* are unique. It may stem from the same examplar as *C*, but the evidence is too limited to determine this. At §2 both omit 'itaque', though this is a logical revision to make following the omission of the prologue. At §5, both *C* before correction and *F* read 'monachorum'.



### *R*: Excerpts from Peter of Cornwall, *Liber reuelationum*, Lambeth, Palace Library, MS. 51, fols. 363r--364r

Peter of Cornwall (1139/40--1221) became an Augustinian canon in 1170 at Holy Trinity, Aldgate, becoming its its prior in 1197. His *Liber reuelationum* is a large compilation of visions and marvels. It survives in a single manuscript: Lambeth, Palace Library, MS. 51, which Robert Easting and Richard Sharpe demonstrate was written under Peter's direction in 1200, including his added notes [@eastingPeterCornwallBook2013, pp. 33, 342--352].

*Liber reuelationum* 2.671--673 (fols. 363r--364r) present five excerpts from the life of Frideswide [@eastingPeterCornwallBook2013, p. 512], woven together under similar headings to those in the original:

- [fol. 363ra--b, from §7] *Qualiter diabolus et cum eo caterua demonum in specie Cristi et sanctorum angelorum apparuerunt sancte Fredesuide. se Cristum et sanctos angelos mencientes. et eam eos adorare rogantes. Set a sancta uirgine deprehensi⹎ et exprobrati euanuerunt. dclxxi.* Cum diabolus nulla calliditate sanctam Fredesuidam subuertere potuit⹎ elatus in antique uesanie sue presumptionem … et permansit intrepida. 

- [fol. 363rb--va, from §§11--12] *Qualiter Algaro rege uolente accipere in coniugem sanctam Fredesuidam apparuit angelus ei precipiens ut fugeret ultra Tamisiam dicens quod inueniret ibi contra eam et nautam et nauem paratam. Quibus ita ut angelus dixerat inuentis⹎ postquam sancta uirgo in nauicula Tamisiam transierat. nauta et nauis disparuerunt. dxlxxii.* Audita fama sancte Fredesuide uirginis rex Algarus misit ad eam nuntios ut ducerit eam in uxorem. Sed illa et nuncios et regem spernit. Repedantes itaque iniri⹎ que gesta sunt … nec itineris ducem uspiam conspiciunt.

- [fols. 363vb--364ra, from §§19, 21] *Qualiter angelus domini predixit sancte Fredesuide diem mortis sue. et cum iam proxima esset morti⹎ salutauit sanctam Katerinam. et sanctam Ceciliam ad se uenientes. dclxxiii.* Diem transitus sancte Fredesuide … cepit ilico destitui. Mortis igitur hora appropinquante⹎ intentis ad superna … proclamabat. Bene uenitis uirgines beate. Ad uocem itaque proclamantis … unguentum effusum uniuersum impleuit orbem.

Legendaries were certainly among Peter's source material [@eastingPeterCornwallBook2013, p. 22]. He probably drew the life of Frideswide from a volume similar to the Gotha manucript. The immediately preceding material includes the *Vita sanctorum Aethelredi et Aethelberti martyrum et sanctarum uirginum Miltrudis et Edburgis* (*BHL* 2644ab, at 2.612--614) to which *G* is the only witness [@colkerHagiographicPolemic1977]; and Dominic of Evesham's *Vita sancti Ecgwini* (*BHL* 2434b, at 2.632) in its Digby-Gotha recension [@lapidgeDigbyGothaRecensionLife1979]. Immediately before Frideswide is a set of extracts on Mildrith, including from Goscelin's *Vita sanctae Mildrethae* (*BHL* 5960, at 2.664--666), to which *G* is one of six witnesses [@rollasonMildrithLegendStudy1982, p. 107], though Peter also draws on two other works for this figure. A similar pattern is visible in his *Vita sanctae Eadburgae uirginis* (*BHL* 2384a) excerpts, for which Peter used a fuller version of the text than the one that now exists, appearing in his book with other Kentish saints in calendrical order [@loveEadburhLymingeHer2019, pp. 337--338].

Peter's text is almost flawless, and with punctuation similar to *M.* It consistently spells Frideswide's name 'Fredesuida', a variant not noted in the apparatus.

### *M*: Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS. Laud Misc. 114, fols. 132r--140r

The oldest and most accurate complete source for Robert's life is in Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS. Laud Misc. 114. It shares a booklet or fascicule of the volume with a *Vita* and *Translatio sancte Wenefrede* by Robert of Shrewsbury (d. 1168). Winifred's life is another literary adaptation of a less ornate life written earlier in the twelfth century [@graySaintsEdgeReconfiguring2017]. The booklet is is a simple production written in the 1150s--70s, with elegant coloured initials alternating between red and green. It is part of a broader hagiographical collection that one might call the Pershore Legendary, a collaborative book that had ambitious aspirations but was never completed.

The volume was made by or for Pershore Abbey, a Benedictine community dedicated to Eadburh of Winchester. There is no doubt of its provenance, as 'pershor' is scribbled in a late medieval hand in the upper margin of fol. 23(b)r; the volume is also the sole source for Osbert of Clare's life of Eadburh [edited in @ridyardRoyalSaintsAngloSaxon1988, pp. 255--308]. A table of contents written on the opening leaf in the late twelfth or early thirteenth century is in the same hand as Oxford, St John's College, MS. 96, another book with Pershore connections [@kerSirJohnPrise1955, p. 20]. The book's contents have not changed since this time. Sir John Prise (1501/2--1555) subsequently acquired it, whose son Gregory Prise (1535--1600) willed it to Jesus College, Oxford. William Laud donated it to the Bodleian on 16 June 1636.

Past analysis has treated the volume as a single unit of production rather than as a composite manuscript [@coxeLaudianManuscripts1973, p. 122; @pachtIlluminatedManuscriptsBodleian1966, p. 3:18]. Instead, it should be understood as an unfinished collection of seven booklets:

i. Augustine, *De doctrina christiana*

     fol. 1r
     :   Table of contents added in a late twelfth-century hand:

First begun at the foot of fol. 81v and then effaced and recopied on fol. 82r. In the same hand as the foregoing text, but a different decoration scheme suggests it is a slightly later addition.

vii. Katherine (25 Nov)

     fols. 164r--184r
     :   *Passio sancte Katerine* (*BHL* 1663); divided at the end into five lessons for the second and third nocturns (fols. 181v--183v).

If one omits the added material for Audoin and Thomas Becket (and presumably Andrew), the volume follows the order of the church year. The clustered dates, as well as the unfinished additions, suggest that the volume had greater ambitions than it achieved.

Its booklets were written within a decade or two of one another, all in English protogothic bookhands, following a relatively consistent layout. The Laudian binder trimmed the volume to 265 × 180 mm, though not aggressively; part vii remains slightly smaller than the rest. There are many variants in the details between booklets that suggest different producers: whether the ruling is in drypoint or plummet; the style of initials and decoration; their completeness; and the use of catchwords:

i. Frame for written area 189 × 101 mm. Ruling in drypoint. Opening initial in red; space left for other initials and rubrics but left incomplete.

ii. Frame for written area 192 × 130 mm. Ruling in plummet. Flourished simple puzzle initial in blue and green (fol. 24r). Coloured initials alternating between red and green.

iii. Frame for written area 189 × 125 mm. Ruling in plummet and pencil. Flourished initials in green with red penwork (fol. 39r, 44v). Coloured initials alternating between green and red. After the opening rubric, further rubrics were intended for each work (a trimmed guide for the rubricator survives on fol. 48v) but left incomplete.

iv. Frame for written area 189 × 129 mm. Ruling in plummet  and pencil.  Coloured initials alternating between green and red. Flourished paraphs for added words (fols. 72r, 77r, 80r) and other descenders (fol. 78v). A more involved decoration scheme was planned for fols. 82r--84r, with space for six- and seven- line drop capitals (left incomplete). Neumes sketched at the foot of fol. 79r.

v. Frame for written area 189 × 101 mm, with  catchwords for quires 12--14. Ruling in pencil. Simple puzzle initials (fols. 85r, 107v), some flourished with penwork in varying styles (fols. 86v, 87v, 88v).

vi. Frame for written area 191 × 130 mm. Ruling in pencil. Coloured initials alternating between red and green, some with simple flourishing.

vii. Leaves 260 × 167 mm. Frame for written area 180 × 110 mm. Ruling in drypoint. Coloured initials in red (one in green, fol. 183v).

The volume is collated 1--3^8^ (fols. 1--23b) \| 4^8^ (fols. 24--31), 5^8^ (fols. 32--38; 7th cancelled) \| 6--9^8^ (fols. 39--68) \| 10--11^8^ (fols. 69--84) \| 12^8--1^ (fols. 85--91; 1st wanting), 13--14^8^ (fols. 92--108), 15^6--1^ (fols. 109--131; 6th wanting) \| 16--19^8^ (fols. 132--163) \| 20--21^8^ (fols. 164--179), 22^10--5^ (fols. 180--184; 1st, 3rd--4th, 9th--10th cancelled). Although there are 170 leaves, they are foliated 1--186: doubling fols. 23a--23b, 49a--49b, 65a--65b; omitting fols. 99, 111--19, and 121--9 (the two leaves after fol. 110 numbered 120 and 130, continuing with 131); fols. i, ii, 185, and 186 are flyleaves (the outer modern paper, the inner modern parchment).

This broadly consistent approach might suggest that the booklets represent contributions from different monastic communities. Leland's record of saints' lives at Osney Abbey (described below), including the same lives of Frideswide and Winifred, might have been the source for part vi. This scenario does not, however, fully account for the unfinished copy of *De doctrina christiana*. Its size is common for books of its thickness, but would be atypical for a significantly longer book. It is also possible that it merely represents a project to organize what were originally intended as separate booklets.

The scribe of the life of Frideswide presents the life under a list of chapter headings, corresponding to the sections indicated by initial letters but not repeated within the text. The manuscript mostly relies on the standard *punctus*, *punctus elevatus* (⹎), and *punctus quaestionis* for punctuation. It also includes a mark similar to a tilde written on the baseline (˷) found in other manuscripts associated with Oxford (such as Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS. Digby 177 and Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS. 380) and southwestern England in the later twelfth century [@gullickTwelfthcenturyManuscriptLetters1990].<!-- chk range --> The original scribe also corrected the text, introducing errors in a few cases where this is done by conjecture.


### *G*: Gotha, Forschungsbibliothek, MS. Memb. I 81, fols. 225r--230r

Gotha, Forschungsbibliothek, MS. Memb. I 81 is a hagiographical collection written in southern England in the latter half of the fourteenth century [Teresa Webber's dating in @rushforthMedievalHagiographyCuthburg2000, p. 295; contents described in @hopfAbendlandischenHandschriftenForschungs1994, pp. 58--61; @grosjeanCodiceHagiographicoGothano1940; @grosjeanCodicisGothaniAppendix1940]. It is a larger book (315 × 230 mm) with a similar double-column format to the Romsey Legendary. Its contents appear to be organized by categories of saints, focusing on martyrs, confessors, and virgins [@townsendEleventhCenturyLifeBirinus1989, p. 133]. Its provenance is unknown; its first record at the library is a 1704 inventory. It includes saints from several regions of England, making it difficult to connect the volume with a particular community. Several studies have used it as a key witness to various hagiographical works [@loveEadburhLymingeHer2019; @birkettSaintsLivesJocelin2010, pp. 60--77; @loveThreeEleventhcenturyAngloLatin1996; @lapidgeWulfstanWinchesterLife1991; @rollasonMildrithLegendStudy1982; @lapidgeDigbyGothaRecensionLife1979; @colkerHagiographicPolemic1977; @colkerGothaCodexDealing1968; @talbotLifeSaintWulsin1959; @grosjeanViesMiraclesPetroc1956; @wilmartLegendeSteEdith1938a, pp. 302--307].

Frideswide's life is the last item in the manuscript, presented as in *M* with a list of chapter headings, but with them also integrated with the text in the margins. Its punctuation is minimal, generally marking out the same sentences as *M* but without internal points. It uses the spelling 'Frideswytha', not noted after its first instance in this apparatus. The original scribe made few visible corrections to the text, but a contemporary reader added several marginal glosses and conjectures.

### *C*: Cambridge, Gonville and Caius College, MS. 129/67, pp. 167--178

<!--chk The University and College Libraries of Cambridge -->
While the text's other witnesses have a hagiographic focus, it features in Cambridge, Gonville and Caius College, MS. 129/67 as an addition to a portable (240 × 167 mm) composite collection of theological treatises. M.R. James interprets it as a monastic book in origin, though there is no evidence for this [@jamesDescriptiveCatalogueManuscripts1907, pp. 1:137--138].

<!-- paper block = 167w x 240h x 16d

with binding = 173w x 240h x 38d -->

The volume consists of two major booklets written England in the late twelfth century, with the *Life of Frideswide* added in the mid-thirteenth century:

pp. 2--3
: List of chapters in Richard of St Victor

p. 4
: Summary contents

pp. 5--36
: Richard of St Victor, *De exterminatione mali et promotione boni*

pp. 37--135
: Ambrose, *De officiis*<!-- (*CPL* 144) -->

pp. 136--166
: Ambrose, *De mysteriis*<!-- (*CPL* 155) -->

pp. 167--178
: *Vita sancte Frideswide* (*BHL* 3162), under an added rubric, 'Incipit uita sancte Frideswide uirginis. xiiii kalendas Nouembris.'

The Ambrose and Richard of St Victor booklets were combined at a fairly early date, as shown by a thirteenth-century list of contents, with fourteenth-century additions (p. 4):

> \\Rich. De exterminacione mali et promotione boni/\
> Ambr. de officiis. libri. iii.\
> Item. Ambr. de misteriis siue initiandis. libri. vi. \\Hoc est de sacramentis/

The *Life of Frideswide* was intended to accompany these works, as its scribe added a further line:

> Item uita Sancte frideswide Virginis.

The Richard and Ambrose booklets have separate hands and styles of decoration. The volume is collated 1^4^ (fol. i and pp. 1--4; 1st pasted to the board), 2--3^8^ (pp. 5--36) | 4--11^8^ (pp. 37--164) | 12^4^ (pp. 165--172), 13^4^ (pp. 173--178; 4th pasted to the board). The *Life of Frideswide* was added to blank leaves at the end of the book along with two added gatherings, giving the volume its present form.

The books' creators are unknown, though there are nearly-decipherable inscriptions at the head of p. 4 and the foot of p. 5. It has travelled in university circles since at least the later fourteenth century. It was owned by Master John Pulham, an early fellow of Clare Hall.^['Liber constat M. Iohanni Pulham de Clarehall' (fol. ir).] The Cambridge *rotulus* of 1371 describes him as a priest in the diocese of Ely and master of arts [Cambridge, University Archives, Luard 82\*\*(1), @courtenaySupplicationsPopeUniversity2018, p. 33; @emdenBiographicalRegisterUniversity1963, p. 462; @jacobPetitionsBeneficesEnglish1945, p. 55]. It was one of two books that Walter Crome (d. 1453), a fellow of Gonville Hall, acquired from William Laceby in 1431, chaplain of Margerie Sparwe<!-- ? --> of Colchester.^['Liber emptus per Crome de capellano' (p. 1); 'Liber emptus per magistrum Walterum Crome de domino Willelmo Lacebi Capellano margerie Sparwe<!-- chk --> pro vii s. iiij d. anno domini millesimo Tricesimo primo. in festo circumcisionis' (p. 2).] Walter gave the the other (Cambridge, University Library, MS. Ii.3.9) to the university in 1444 [@hardwickCatalogueManuscriptsPreserved1856, pp. 412--415]. He was the vicar of St Peter's Church in Colchester when he wrote his will in 1452 [@clarkeUniversityCollegeLibraries2002, pp. 33, 683--684<!-- chk -->]. He gave ninety-three books to Cambridge University Library and seven to Gonville Hall [@lovattCollegeUniversityBook2006, pp. 158--159; @oatesCambridgeUniversityLibrary1986, pp. 24--27<!-- chk -->; @brookeHistoryGonvilleCaius1985, p. 34].

Staple marks show that the book was once part of Gonville Hall's chained library. A fifteenth-century dedication to students' common use conspicuously omits the *Life of Frideswide* (p. 4):

> Liber Ricardi sancti Victoris de exterminio mali et Ambrosii
de officiis et Ambrosii de misteriis et Ambrosii de sacramentis.
donatur per magistrum Walterum Crome sacre theologie professorem.
collegio nostro Annunciacionis uirginis gloriose ad utilitatem
studencium ut sit in communi libraria eiusdem Collegii non
quouismodo inter libros distributiuuos sociorum euocandus.
sub pena deperdicionis eiusdem. Ad librariam communem uniuersitatis
in casu quod defecerit euocandus anno domini 1444 in festo Hugonis.

M.R. James mentions an 'old binding' in red leather, but the library recovered it during an aggressive binding campaign of the mid-twentieth century, preserving only a slice with an eighteenth-century list of contents is inside the front cover.

The *Vita sancte Frideswide* text in *C* omits the list of chapter headings found in *M* and *G.* It nonetheless marks new chapters with space for two-line initials, left unexecuted. There may have been an intent to add the headings in the margins, similar to *G.*

*C*'s scribe worked from a text similar to *M* but made many classicizing conjectures. There are many differences in word order from the other witnesses; the scribe intentionally introduced many of these during correction. There are many more significant emendations, such as an added adjective 'teneram' to 'uirginem' (§18). Many of these changes are highly intelligent, and it can be difficult determine whether they are conjectures or copied from the exemplar. Others are too clever. In §16, as Frideswide begins to pray for the young man from Seacourt, *M* and *G* read 'procedit' ('she comes forth'), while *C* reads 'procidit' ('she prostrates herself') -- but the point in context is that Frideswide is overcoming her desire to come out of hiding. A later hand also added glosses in the margin, such as 'casa pastoralis' beside 'porcorum tutamen' (§12).

The book appears to have been stored damp at one point, with most of its contents of the last page (p. 178) adhering to the facing page when later opened. As a result, there are effectively only two sources for the text's conclusion.

### *F*: Fontenelle, Abbey of Saint-Wandrille (untraced)

*Acta sanctorum ordinis S. Benedicti* (1672, revised 1734) prints sections 2--8 of Robert's life, later designated *BHL* 3163: 'Anno ab incarnatione … detrimento integritatis quæram' [@acheryActaSanctorumOrdinis1672, pp. 561--563]. The text is from a Fontenelle legendary ('Legendario Fontanellensi') that was already fragmentary in the seventeenth century, and has not reappeared among the hagiographical manuscripts identified with the abbey [@dolbeauAnciensPossesseursManuscrits1980, pp. 199, 210, 222]. This version makes adjustments to the text to abridge and simplify it. It notably omits Frideswide's memorization of the psalter ('Quis etenim non obstupesceret … contemplari uultum eius') and the description of her ascetic practices ('Non mollibus … excessisse uirile'). Many of its variants are deliberate, and the printing process introduced others, but it nonetheless its source was likely more accurate than either *G* or *C*. A list of refectory readings from Saint-Wandrille assigns a text on Frideswide for 19 October, and this might have been its intended function [Rouen, Bibliothèque patrimoniale Villon, MS. 1212, fol. 4v, edited in @laporteOrdoLectionumUs1937, p. 198: 'Frideswindes, virg., In lectonnario. Ad mat. legatur de communi virg.'].

### Oxford, Osney Abbey (untraced)

John Leland reports seeing a life of St Frideswide held by the Augustinian canons at Osney Abbey between 1536 and 1540. He gives no author, but it is presumably Robert's life that he saw, since the other items he lists are of a length more substantial than the Worcester Legendary life. From Osney he also lists Eadmer of Canterbury's *Vita sancti Odonis Cantuariensis* (*BHL* 6289) and Robert of Shrewsbury's life of Winifred (*BHL* 8849) [@webberLibrariesAugustinianCanons1998, nos. A26.†2, A26.3, A26.4]. These entries could all have been from the same volume, and since the latter appears also in the Pershore Legendary, the two volumes might have been directly related.

Leland's *Collectanea* preserves traces of either the Osney manuscript or the Pershore Legendary. He extracts Osbert of Clare's life of Eadburh, immediately followed by passages from Robert's life of Frideswide ('Ex libello incerti autoris de vita Sanctæ Fredeswidæ virginis') [Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS. top. gen. c. 1, pp. 337–342<!-- chk not 2–4 -->: printed in @lelandJoannisLelandiAntiquarii1774, pp. 277-279; @dodsworthMonasticonAnglicanum1655, pp. 1:173–174; @dugdaleMonasticonAnglicanum1817, p. 2:143]. He abbreviates and modifies quotations, making it impossible to determine whether he was using the Pershore Legendary, though Leland correctly gives the text at §24 as 'uouerat' rather than 'nouerat' as found in *M*.

## Editorial method

This edition follows the same principles as Blair's rendition. It begins with a transcription of *M* and provides a full collation of the other witnesses, substituting their variants as the sense and stemma requires. The opportunity to reassess the manuscripts and include updated scholarship results in a number of different readings. The inclusion of the excerpts in the Fontenelle Legendary and Peter of Cornwall, which Robert Easting and Richard Sharpe brought to light in 2013, prompt a few changes to the text. Usage recorded in the completed *Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources* enables for a more minimal approach to emendation by demonstrating parallels for several passages that appeared to contain errors.

Blair was dependent on a grainy microfilm for *G* borrowed from Michael Lapidge, who has since passed it on to Paul Russell and Rosalind Love. They commissioned a set of colour photographs for the 'Vitae sanctorum Cambriae: Latin Lives of the Welsh Saints' project and were kind enough to share them. This has enabled a more accurate collation, demonstrating that it is a more reliable source than previously thought.

The most visible difference in this edition is the use of medieval punctuation rather than a modern system. Most editors of medieval Latin remove manuscript punctuation and provide marks based on their own vernacular. This practice is a frequent source of misinterpretation, since it does not prompt editors to fully consider the function of medieval marks. Because a German editor will produce a quite different set of marks from an Italian, it is not a great help to students. Conversely, exposure to medieval punctuation systems in print helps students to develop their ability to read manuscripts directly.

As noted above, *M* has an almost entirely coherent system of points, consistent with other early copies of Robert of Cricklade's works. About four fifths of the marks in *R,* *M,* and *C* are identical, presumably reflecting the archetype, while *G* tends to give the same sentences but with almost no internal points to set off phrases. This edition, therefore, largely reproduces the marks from *M* but silently corrects them where the sense requires it, usually based on *C.* This is intended to give additional transparency to the editorial process and give a better sense of the text's intended structure, especially when read aloud.
