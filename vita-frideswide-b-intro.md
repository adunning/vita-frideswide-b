# Introduction

This life of St Frideswide (BHL 3162), anonymous in its manuscripts, is thought to have been written by Robert of Cricklade [@blair:1987saint, p. 80]. He was prior of St Frideswide's in Oxford, a house of Augustinian canons -- now Christ Church -- from 1138/39 until his death between 1174 and 1180. Archaeological studies show a major expansion effort begun during his time. He tells in a letter to Benedict of Peterborough how his leg, swollen for many years, was healed after a visit to the shrine of Thomas Becket in 1171/72 [@robertson:1875miracula, chaps. 2.51--52; @magnússon:1875thómas, chap. 111]. The cult of St Frideswide flourished soon afterwards, culminating in a festive translation in 1180 and a series of miracles documented by Prior Philip, Robert's successor [@dunning:2018frideswides]. Likely part of the effort to establish Frideswide as a major saint, the present text is an update to another life of Frideswide written earlier in the twelfth century [translated in @blair:2004saint]. This translation is made from an edition by John Blair [@blair:1987saint, pp. 101--116].

- [fol. 363ra--b] *Qualiter diabolus et cum eo caterua demonum in specie Cristi et sanctorum angelorum apparuerunt sancte Fredesuide. se Cristum et sanctos angelos mencientes. et eam eos adorare rogantes. Set a sancta uirgine deprehensi⸵ et exprobarati euanuerunt. dclxxi.* Cum diabolus nulla calliditate sanctam Fredesuidam subuertere potuit⸵ elatus in antique uesanie sue presumptionem … et permansit intrepida. [§7]

- [fol. 363rb--va] *Qualiter Algaro rege uolente accipere in coniugem sanctam Fredesuidam apparuit angelus ei precipiens ut fugeret ultra Tamisiam dicens quod inueniret ibi contra eam et nautam et nauem paratam. Quibus ita ut angelus dixerat inuentis⸵ postquam sancta uirgo in nauicula Tamisiam transierat. nauta et nauis disparuerunt. dxlxxii.* Audita fama sancte Fredesuide uirginis rex Algarus misit ad eam nuntios ut ducerit eam in uxorem. Sed illa et nuncios et regem spernit. Repedantes itaque iniri⸵ que gesta sunt … nec itineris ducem uspiam conspiciunt. [§§11--12]

- [fols 363vb--364ra] *Qualiter angelus domini predixit sancte Fredesuide diem mortis sue. et cum iam proxima esset morti⸵ salutauit sanctam Katerinam. et sanctam Ceciliam ad se uenientes. dclxxiii.* Diem transitus sancte Fredesuide … cepit ilico destitui. Mortis igitur hora appropinquante⸵ intentis ad superna … proclamabat. Bene uenitis uirgines beate. Ad uocem itaque proclamantis … unguentum effusum uniuersum impleuit orbem. [§§19, 21]
