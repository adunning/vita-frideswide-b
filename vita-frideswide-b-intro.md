# Introduction

This life of St Frideswide (Frithuswith), anonymous in its manuscripts, is thought to have been written by Robert of Cricklade [@blair:1987saint, p. 80]. He was prior of St Frideswide's in Oxford, a house of Augustinian canons -- now Christ Church -- from 1138/39 until his death between 1174 and 1180. Archaeological studies show a major expansion effort begun during his time. He tells in a letter to Benedict of Peterborough how his leg, swollen for many years, was healed after a visit to the shrine of Thomas Becket in 1171/72 [@robertson:1875miracula, chaps. 2.51--52; @magnússon:1875thómas, chap. 111]. The cult of St Frideswide flourished soon afterwards, culminating in a festive translation in 1180 and a series of miracles documented by Prior Philip, Robert's successor [@dunning:2018frideswides]. Likely part of the effort to establish Frideswide as a major saint, the present text is an update to another life of Frideswide written earlier in the twelfth century [translated in @blair:2004saint]. This translation is made from an edition by John Blair [@blair:1987saint, pp. 101--116].
