# The prologue to the life of St Frideswide the virgin begins

^1^My most dear brethren, I have taken care to bring together everything into one book on the life and miracles of the most blessed virgin Frideswide, worthy of all veneration, which I have been able to learn in chronicles as well as in certain books of true histories or in catalogues of the saints of England.

It is clearly evident that, whoever that writer was of the life of that most holy virgin, he has avoided error in many things by far -- although some in their pride seem to think little of him. Dismissing a pen led in simplicity, they approve of a flower that cares more for its appearance than the usefulness of its fruit.

# The life begins

## 1. St Frideswide's father and mother; her birth and instruction

^2^Around the year 727 from the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ, the king of all ages, the word of God had blossomed and brought forth the greatest fruit in the savage nation of the English. They had seized the island of Britain, devastated it, and put it under the control of its lordship with a bloodthirsty hand. There was a certain vassal king named Didan, an orthodox man and outstanding in all the decency of his ways. He honoured a city with his frequent residence called Oxford in the Saxon tongue, which we can call *Boum Vadum* in Latin.

By divine will, he took a wife suitable to his character named Safrida, from whom he received an heir to his disposition rather than his spoils -- that is to say, an only daughter. He directed that she be called Frideswide when she was cleansed at the fount of holy baptism.

^3^After five years' attentive upbringing, they handed her over to learn the study of letters under the tuition of a very devout matron named Algiva.

As if she were the happiest foretelling of a happy future age, she shone forth in the very beginning of her study, so much that it was clear to everyone that the Holy Spirit had chosen her mind as his dwelling place. For who was not astounded at a young girl, five years old, who had learnt the hundred and fifty psalms of David in some five months and committed them to memory? And her companions did not become jealous from this; but having been touched by the zeal that filled her with charity, she served as beloved by everyone. For she was outstanding thereafter in such favour of humility together with mildness that it was not to see a royal youth but a person in a servile state, obliging all and displaying a feeling of compassion for all. She was clearly 'not a forgetful hearer' of the divine word, 'but a doer of works'.^[James 1.25] For she dutifully stored what she heard from the Scriptures in the bookcase of her heart, devoting herself persistently to return money loaned from the Lord to him 'with interest'.^[Matt. 25.27]

Accordingly, she constantly slaughtered the sacrificial victim of her heart in a burnt offering acceptable to the Lord,^[Cf. Rom. 12.1, Phil. 4.18] in devout rivers of tears with sighs and groans day and night, praying continually that she might deserve to 'dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of her life'^[Ps. 27.4 (Vulg. 26.4)] and to contemplate his face.

## 2. Her mother's death; her advancement into a holy manner of life and the construction of her monastery by her father; how she became a nun; and the death of her father

^4^As an adult, she had not entrusted herself to a husband when her mother passed from the earth.

Lacking any other source of comfort, the virgin was released from her father's protection. As much as she could, she urged him with sound warnings to seek remedies for his soul, as he was about to go in a short time from this place to where the companion of his bed had gone before. Struck at the recent loss of his wife, as is usual, and urged by the constant prayers of his most beloved daughter, he built a church within the compass of the city's walls. It was dedicated in honour of the holy and everlasting Trinity; of the ever-virgin Mary, the mother of God; and of all the saints. He entrusted it to his daughter at her request.

She entered the church and handed herself over intentionally to divine works, entrusting her chastity to the Lord with persistent prayers. She opened her innermost thoughts in her entreaties, giving gifts to the poor with her own hand when they asked. She also neglected the splendour of the world to desire the celestial country ardently. She seemed nearly to have shed the burden of her flesh, and to have put on the armour of immortality.^[Cf. Rom. 13.14; Eph. 6.11] For she did not feed the body with food but enlarged her spirit. She did not dress in soft clothing,^[Cf. Matt. 11.8; Luke 7.25] but kept vigil with the sharpest hair shirts. She did not sleep on softness, but pricked herself if she slept. What can I say of her bed, since it was nothing but the hardest ground? She laid down on it when sleep conquered her, settling her debt to nature; bowing down to the ground, she constantly sought it on her knees when she poured out prayers to the Lord. You would be amazed that the royal daughter raised on kingly feasts fought the wantonness of hunger with a rough meal of cheap vegetables and a small portion of barley bread; and that she overcame the urgent burning licentiousness of thirst with a mouthful of water. What more? She so embarked on 'the narrow and hard way that leads to life'^[Matt. 7.14] that there was nothing further.

O unhappy people of this time, 'whose god is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things',^[Phil. 3.19] who put piety forward with their habit, but gainsay it with their conduct and life! They turn their eyes onto themselves with the cheap garment of appearance, but they disrupt their bowels in overindulgence of fine food. If they ever fast, they 'search earth and sea'^[Lucan, *Pharsalia* 5.262] whence they might compensate for the loss of fasting. But this is not the 'fast that I have chosen',^[Is. 58.5--6] says the Lord.

England was amazed, everyone wondered, perceiving that the weak sex was surpassing manly strength at a tender age. But the happy young girl's father was brought to dance with joy, because he had thought that his heir would provide a leader of earthly affairs, but now he looked to heavenly desire.

^5^And what is more, to demonstrate that she had fully put off every hope of a perishable future age, she asked her father that she might deserve to receive the habit of nuns. With a wise plan, she was taking precautions, without doubt, that she should not by chance be forced to enter a marriage after her father's death, and to corrupt her intention to remain a virgin  in every respect. Besides, the most blessed virgin was sick of adorning her body in purple: she had known that she was redeemed by the blood of Christ while she was condemned by faithless, foul death. Betrothing herself with the ring of faith, she despised gold and precious stones as merchandise of little worth.

King Didan, rejoicing greatly at his daughter's plan, ordered the diocesan bishop to be summoned near and asked for the habit of nuns to be given to his most beloved daughter. Advancing in emulation of the most blessed virgin, roughly twelve girls of noble birth 'forsook all and followed the Lord',^[Luke 5.11] 'walking in all his commandments and precepts'^[Luke 1.6] following the example of Frideswide, beloved of God. Although they could not equal her in virtues, they still glowed to be made her partners by sharing in the kingdom of heaven. And so, by the king's generosity, they built lodgings for themselves, most fit for holiness, alongside a church. There, melodious happiness echoed day and night in the mind of the virgins with a harmonious voice, singing psalms and hymns.

^6^Meanwhile, the king himself sunk to his bed, struck by a heavy fever; and brought to the last, strengthened by the viaticum of the body of Christ, he slept with his fathers,<!-- source? --> finishing his days in good old age.

## 3. How she increased day by day in virtues after the death of father; and how the Devil, defeated, departed from her

Blessed Frideswide was thus deprived of the comfort of both her parents. She desired the 'Father who is in heaven'^[Matt. 6.9] ardently; she hurried to him with whatever steps she could. For she extended her fasts, she persevered in continual prayer, and furthermore she sought the one her soul loved a hundred times a day and a hundred times every night on bended knees.

^7^But who can prevail in one's attempts to be good in the world without someone who is particularly harmful becoming jealous? For he who was able to drive away the first person from the joys of paradise attempts to cast down everyone. And because he could not overthrow Frideswide's mind with the goad of temptation, he displayed a physical spectacle for her bodily eyes to fight with her hand-to-hand.

And he was puffed up into the hope of his ancient madness, in which he was declaring that he would be like the Highest, and disguised himself as Christ. And, accompanied by a band of demons disguised as angels of light, he approached the virgin with these words: 'Come, my beloved, come; because it is time for you to gain "the crown of glory that cannot fade",^[1 Peter 5.4] which you have deserved. Come and prostrate yourself at the soles of my feet; worship him whom you have long desired. For I wish to appear to you for this: that you may see me for whom you have sighed with such passionate desire, and that you may succeed in entering the reward of eternal life without the trouble of the body.'

The virgin, informed by the Holy Spirit -- by whose inspiration to the human race she discovered this enemy -- began to speak to him thus: 'Why, most miserable creature, do you presume to promise to others what you do not have, nor can have because of your pride? What is immortal life to you? While living you died, and while remaining you sink always into eternal death. But I, a wretched and most miserable sinner, would have shared in your damnation if the mercy of my redeemer Christ  -- whom you most wickedly pretend to be -- had not come before. For he is 'my hope, even from my youth.'^[Ps. 71.5 (Vulg. 70.5)]

At the virgin's lowly words, that proud one disappeared, not enduring the Spirit, and he filled the air with horrible howling and a deadly stench. Blessed Frideswide continued in prayer and remained in vigils with a calm mind, and remained undaunted.

## 4. The blinded messengers of King Algar, and their restoration to health by her prayers

^8^But the deviser of unrighteousness did not rest from the assault of his craft, even though he had gone away conquered and confused. For he drew near King Algar, who was more than wicked enough. He touched the man with unchaste love for the virgin Frideswide, and inflamed him with passion. To cast her down from her monastic habit, he suggested that it was not sinful or wicked to summon the daughter of a king (though a nun) with threats<!-- chk --> to a royal bed. It was to have the best child, and to bring him up to the hope of a kingdom, rather than to lead a lazy life filled with carelessness.

With these spurs of suggestion, the raging king, set in motion, rushed forth as if madly excited. He ordered his messengers to speed forth who might bring forward Frideswide with the greatest haste and force her to hasten whether she refused or desired it.

The wicked messengers of the most wicked king fled without delay. They quickly crossed through the space of many lands. Standing in Frideswide's presence, they drew near to accost her with these words: 'King Algar', they said, 'sent us to you, O Frideswide, for the purpose of a future errand to you. But use wise judgement and agree to the king's will -- take the honour of accepting.<!-- chk --> For your opposition will not be without punishment. The king desires you for his bed most intensely, and to join you in the chain of marriage, and to make you a sharer of the kingdom.'

The virgin answered them with a most humble mind, as it always was, with an unassuming voice: 'If I had been inclined to unite with a man in marriage, I would never have the power to refuse the request of King Algar. Now, because I am betrothed to Christ, the king of immortality, I judge it truly wicked that I should refuse him and offer assent with that man in mortal death. Looking down on the fruit of immortality, I would seek a mortal descendant with the loss of chastity.'<!-- chk -->

They said, 'This trick will not help you; because if you refuse to agree and obey the king's will in order to honour the nobility of your desire, you will suffer many wrongs to your chastity, dragged to a brothel. Unwilling, you will be made a plaything for bawds. Shamefully spoiled and repudiated, you will thus finally be taught that a sound mind does not pollute royal honour of this kind.'

At this, the virgin replied, 'Your threats would be utterly to be feared, if it were not that the Lord has the power to hold back the hands of the ungodly, so that they cannot accomplish the works that they put forward to undertake in their wicked mind. Moreover, the body cannot be polluted by any contagion of defilement except by the consent of the mind. And assuredly, the wholeness of a body that corruption of the mind has polluted is not pleasing to God. It is even so if the violence of unchaste people should trouble the cloisters of the seal of chastity. When free will opposes it, it is rightly restored with an incorrupt mind to the reward of its wholeness by God the examiner.

^9^At the girl's answers, it was as if the agents of wickedness were dazed by the sight of the noonday sun. Still, they continued in the stubbornness of their madness. Since they did not know what they might set against her further in their shock at her great constancy, they prepared to reply by force.

But Frideswide, fleeing for refuge to God her defender, poured forth prayers with tears on high, shouting with a great voice and saying, '"Arise, Lord, let not man take comfort; let the nations be judged in your sight, and let them know that they are but men."^[Ps. 9.19–20 (Vulg. 9.20–21)] "Take hold of shield and buckler and arise for my help. Say to my soul, 'I am your salvation.'"^[Ps. 35.2–3 (Vulg. 34.2–3)] "O the depth of your wisdom, Lord God, how unsearchable are your judgements and how inscrutable your ways!"^[Rom. 11.13] Truly "nobody has trusted in you and been forsaken".'^[Sirach 2.11–12]

Behold the 'wicked men'^[Gen. 13.13] who do not wish to hear the voice of your handmaid, that they may do good. Having first lost their eyesight, they were forced unwillingly to cease from their wrongful deeds. They learned by experience what they had failed to pay attention to when they were taught salvation.

The city was filled with the miracle's strength without delay. They gathered from everywhere. Everyone wondered and was afraid. Falling forward at the virgin's feet, they asked humbly for compassion on the blind men, that she would not consider the crimes of the foolish and therefore most miserable men, but be favourably inclined to think it fit to pray for them -- and that the pious woman might restore their sight by her prayer where the wretches had been deprived of them by their own obstinacy.

^10^But the vessel of devoutness did not endure long torturing of the wicked men, or the people's sobbing in their request. She was turned to prayers; she entreated God on her knees. 'Invisible and unchangeable God', she said, 'the creator of all creatures, at whose will things are made that are not, at whose wish all things remain, who shaped humanity anew, sinning by their own guilt, to life: restore these most wretched men's sight, that this people may know that you are 'full of compassion and mercy, long-suffering and of great goodness and truth',^[Ps. 86.16 (Vulg. 85.15)] 'rewarding each according to his work',^[Ps. 62.12 (Vulg. 61.13)] who lives and reigns through the ages of ages.'

At the blessed virgin's voice, when everyone standing round answered, 'Amen', the wretches' sight was restored. But they threw themselves down at her feet, profitably pricked at heart, demanding her forgiveness of their crime.

She said to them, 'Do not suppose that this happened by my virtues, but by the Saviour's mercy, and by the faith of the people themselves praying. Remember these things that you have endured, and from now on, do not trouble the handmaids of Christ.

## 5. How she dealt with the madness of King Algar, informed by an angel

^11^And so, the men returned and reported to the king what had happened in order.

But he said, 'By no means shall her charms or deceptive dogmas or magic art snatch her from my hands. But because she has dared to disdain me: after I have ravaged her at my pleasure, she will indeed be handed over to be defiled by the abuse of bawds.'

He said these things and called for horses with precipitous haste, driven by rage, and he embarked on the journey to the city where the virgin dwelled, urged on by a wicked desire.

O how great is the multitude of your mercies, Lord, who does not forsake those who hope in you.^[cf. section 9, above, and Sirach 2.11–12] In the very night, while Frideswide, unaware of these things, was intent on prayer in her usual custom, your holy angel stood by her, saying, 'Are you unaware, O virgin, that the most wicked King Algar will be at the gates of the city tomorrow to indulge his lust, if he is given the possibility of intruding into the chastity of your virginity?'

Hearing these things, the holy woman 'became immensely frightened',^[1 Macc. 16.22] and not so much from such a sudden angelic vision as from the hastening of savage wickedness. She stood dazed, not knowing what to do.

The angel said to her, 'Do not fear, Frideswide: the Lord Jesus Christ will guard the pleasant dwelling place which you have made ready for him in your virginity. The deluded^[DMLBS, s.v. 'illudere 3': 'with reference to dreams'; 'with reference to nocturnal emission of semen'.] king will turn back, disappointed by the hope of his malice, and the punishment of everlasting blindness will destroy it. But now, hurry, and follow the path that leads to the River Thames with whichever of your companions you wish. You will find a light boat prepared by God, and in it a sailor to guide the way.' He said these things, and suddenly disappeared from the virgin's view.

^12^Frideswide gave thanks to God and arose happy from prayer. Taking two of her sisters with her, she reached the Thames, and according to the angel's word, found a little boat alongside the river. They stepped into it and saw a young man sitting to one side, with shining garb and a most pleasing countenance. He soothed them with his sweet speech and settled them in the little boat. A miraculous thing: a miraculous onrush of power. In the space of an hour they were carried across ten miles, and they put ashore close to the village called Bampton.

But when they put ashore, they saw neither the boat nor their journey's guide anywhere. They made their way towards a path that they found at once alongside the village and went into a wood not far apart from it. The path stretched out into the depths of the forest, and they followed it. Finally, they saw a shed built to protect pigs against bad weather. Its inhabitants had now abandoned it for a long time, to such an extent that ivy had grown up and covered it from every side. With a hidden approach, its entry seemed to refuse anyone wishing to go in. The virgin entered with her companions. She first fortified it with the sign of the cross. Then she decided that they would remain there, in such a manner as God had arranged it, given that it seemed to suit their needs.

## 6. The blinding of King Algar, and why kings do not go into Oxford

^13^Meanwhile, the wicked king came to Oxford, attempting to learn where Frideswide had fled from the inhabitants by threats and entreaties and offering rewards. But because he was not to know God's secrets, just as this act was in none of their counsel, in this way their speech could not be uncovered. For this reason, the king was moved to unendurable rage, as if he were demented. Gazing frightfully on the city, he swore to destroy it.

And when he was approaching the gate that opens to the north, going where the onslaught of his madness drove him, he suddenly lost his sight. He learnt that there is nothing human wickedness contrives that stands up against divine power. The foolish man became frightened, therefore, at the sudden vengeance of divine power in him, and he did not cease from the determination of his wickedness. A heart of Pharaoh returned home, seeing the plagues of Egypt and persisting in the blindness he earned. He went without the comfort of his lost sight all the days of his life, just as he did not cease from the obstinacy of his presumptuous conduct. Indeed, on account of the most just punishment of the cruellest tyrant, there is an inborn dread in the kings of England, so that not even one of his successors presumes to enter the city of Oxford.

But Frideswide, now elevated as if into the wilderness, concentrated on allowing time for God alone, always holding Christ only before her eyes, in her mind, and in her soul. Neither by day nor night did she cease to speak of him, to worship him, and to call on him in persistent prayers. She remained in the isolation of the forest mentioned earlier for nearly three years, but not unknown to the inhabitants. For the lamp of God could not hide for long: the fragrance and light of her virtues was pouring forth everywhere.

## 7. The girl healed through a drop of liquid falling from Frideswide's hands

^14^In Bampton, mentioned earlier, there was a girl from a noble family who remained struck with the  affliction of blindness by the ancient enemy, to her own burden and her parents' sorrow. But divine compassion did not endure the insolence of the enemy's attack into the woman's loss any longer. Someone stood by her in a dream as she slept, saying, 'Go into the wood to the virgins' dwelling place, and anoint your eyes with a drop of water flowing from the palms of blessed Frideswide while she washes her hands. You will receive your sight.'

The woman awoke and became very glad when the day first revealed itself to the earth. She did not delay to tell her parents what she had seen in her dreams. They congratulated their daughter, as if she had already received her sight. They set out on a journey at once. After walking swiftly, they arrived at the virgins' house. Standing at the door and knocking, they asked eagerly that they might deserve to be present when Frideswide washed her hands. This was not denied to those asking, although she had hardly ever allowed any of her sisters to wash in the water flowing from her hands. Even so, she did not deny those to be present, as though she were not in hiding, because they had asked so earnestly from outside. And so, the girl eagerly snatched the first falling drop of water that she could. When she had washed her eyes with it, she quickly recovered her vision.

O how virtuous a virgin in her hands and clean heart! From her hands, what was thought unclean was of use at the service of such well-being. Let them cease, I ask, who chatter against the Redeemer's promises, saying in the Gospel, '"But not a hair of your head will perish."'^[Luke 21.18] Let them cease, I say. For a hair is more precious that is provided to protect and adorn the head -- born of the flesh and rooted in the flesh -- than blocking filth out of a mass of sweat or corrupting out of whatever things you like that caresses the skin's surface. And behold, for it is not free from the service of miracles in the servants and handmaids of God. Therefore, he who was able to restore vision to a blind girl through washing dirt from his handmaid is able to place hair on the head or body, as he pleases, of those restored to life in the resurrection.<!--add a note: source? baldness? -->

This is indeed a marvellous miracle and amazing power. 'It is better to gain from this than from silver and gold',^[Prov. 3.14] and from stones however precious you like. From this it is likewise pleasing to cry aloud, full of hope, saying with gladness, '"O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is your name"^[Ps. 8.1 (Vulg. 8.2), Ps. 8.9 (Vulg. 8.10)] in all your works.' They returned with joy and published this deed abroad throughout their neighbourhood.

## 8. How she lived in the settlement called Binsey, and obtained a well by prayer

^15^But the 'virgin most wise'^[The opening of a Magnificat antiphon used for various Marian feasts.] did not wait until the stormy approval of flattery might snatch the vessel of oil from her hands, that when the bridegroom came she would not know from what source their lamps' light would form.^[Cf. Matt. 25.1–13] She thus decided that it would be useful to flee from the praises of people, by no means helpful to her, who wished to see her with wild wonder because of the greatness of the deed.

Therefore, she called together the companions of her isolation and said, 'I judge that it is now the right time for us to approach our own monastery. For our sisters might perhaps, God forbid, have refrained from their good way of life, either in being typically anxious for us, or falling down a deep pit in sadness at our absence.'

Thus she spoke, and went aboard a readied boat with her sisters. By the work of sailing, it was brought vigorously, running fleetly, to the settlement near the city called Binsey.

She disembarked from the boat to see clearly, considering the place. She considered that it would usefully be a short distance from the city, and devoting herself to beloved tranquillity. It would not be burdensome for the virgins whom she had left in the monastery to come; and it would be less suited to the inhabitants, always seeking something to wonder at for its newness.

In the settlement mentioned earlier there was a place planed with trees of many different kinds. It was called Thornbury in the Saxon tongue for the great number of different kinds of brambles -- isolated indeed and most suited to devotion. She built a chapel in it at once, and a great many buildings suited to the use of holy people. And because the riverbed was far away, and it seemed inappropriate to her that the sisters should go there to drink water, she obtained a well by prayer. It is there to this day, providing the free gift of health to many who drink from it.

She was hoping to hide here, to devote herself to beloved tranquillity and avoid the crowds of people.

## 9. How she loosed a man's hand from an axe's haft by her prayers

^16^What are you attempting, beloved virgin of God? What, I say? Do you seek places of concealment? But you cannot succeed to escape notice for long. The Lord says in the Gospel, 'A city set on a mountain cannot be hidden.'^[Matt. 5.14] You are indeed a city of Christ, the king of all things, built with towers of virtues and defences of good works, and established on that mountain which is 'a stone cut out of a mountain without hands'^[Dan. 2.34, 2.45] and has 'filled the whole world'.^[Dan. 2.35] But you subdue yourself with great humility, and 'whoever humbles himself will be exalted',^[Matt. 23.12] says the same Lord. Be it so. Human sport will by no means seek you, because you are crucified to the world, but the pitiable and oppressed need of the infirm will not cease from searching you out.

Behold, an unfortunate young man close by you in a village called Seacourt: while he was cutting down trees with an axe on a Sunday, not furnishing respect for the day of the Lord's resurrection. His hands (but I shudder to tell it) stuck to the haft at once. He was burned to such a degree that, shouting dreadfully because of the pain's unbearableness, he drove his neighbours to run unwillingly towards the scene. For he could not release his hand because of the pain or loose his fingers from the haft.

The wretched man stood shouting and wailing; his parents stood weeping and scourging themselves with their fists; and his neighbours were terrified of God's vengeful anger, fearing tortures up to death. Why not? Indeed, they beheld an unendurable punishment in the man, and no way to offer help.

Finally, turning round to one another in turn, they said, 'Could not the most blessed virgin Frideswide free our son from this torture by her devout virtues, from whose hands a falling drop of water could restore sight to a blind girl? Let us also lead this man to her dwelling place, that she might feel pity for us and free our son.'

Fitly indeed, I will strongly approve your faith with a show of the example. Pull out, I ask, the one wishing to lie hidden -- pull her out, I say -- and ask for what she will not be able to deny because of her devoutness, showing openly before all how much her virtues have power with God. They do not seek her own glory but his.^[cf. John 7.18]

And without delay, after crossing the river, the young man stood before the virgin's dwelling place. He shouted to her, and requested a remedy of health, cutting short his voice with sobbing.

'Blessed Frideswide', they said, 'have mercy on a young man, suffering tortures because of his own offence. For we know, and we know well, that if you wish it his pain will be released by your prayers and he will be given back his earlier health.'

What will you do, virgin, at such a mournful voice, before such wailing with great misery? Surely the wretched people will not go back deprived of compassion? Surely devoutness will not refuse to grant what your desire of escaping notice was preparing to deny? Behold, the unhappy parents are pleading with prayers, and they are knocking, seeking according to the Saviour's word^[cf. Matt. 7.7–8] so that the pain might be sent away from their son by your intercession, and a remedy of health granted.

Finally therefore, Frideswide came forth, conquered by devoutness, and thus she prayed with rising tears: 'Adonai, Lord God, Father almighty, great and marvellous, who freed your burdened people Israel from the yoke of slavery through the lawgiver Moses, and called upon the Ninevites to return from their unrighteousness through Jonah, unharmed in the belly of a whale: I pray you, Lord, merciful and compassionate through your only-begotten, our Redeemer made before the deeds of these men, do not send away your compassion from these your servants, but provide what they ask, that they might know that you are powerful in all your works, remaining in all ages.'

After she said this and marked him with the sign of the healing cross, his hand was loosed from the haft, and he was restored to his earlier health.

## 10. The fisherman freed from a demon

^17^A short time later, some fishermen were sitting on a little boat in the dead of night. They were waiting to catch prey, with their nets cast. While they were falling asleep, as drowsiness weighed them down, one of them was rolled around, suddenly seized by a demon. A little while after, he made a rush on one of his companions. He prepared to tear him with his teeth and strangle him with his hands. This was a cause of dread and grief to the others. But the rest overcame him, binding his hands behind his back, and led him to the virgin's dwelling place.

When she had gazed upon him, she felt compassion for the misery of people who came to such distress because of their own misdeed that they could be handed over to the arrogance of demons. She groaned, and summoning back her voice from on high, after she poured forth tears  most copiously with a sigh. She first offered prayers to the Lord, and then stretched out her hand to the wretch, forming the sign of the healing cross against the demon. And then she said, 'I adjure you, Satan, through the great name of the Son of the living God, and of our Lord Jesus Christ: depart from this man, made in his image, and from henceforth do not presume to possess him further.

At the virgin's voice the man fell down as if wounded by a fatal blow; and after the author of death was cast out, who had made him wickedly strong, he was made as if dead. This appearance of his body revealed in what a state his soul was, after having been possessed by such an enemy. Seeing this, the virgin drew near, and laying her hand upon him, she said, 'Rise, O man, in the name of Christ Jesus of Nazareth.'

He suddenly rose, restored to good health in mind and body. And he did not refrain from mentioning the deed, but wherever he went, he made known in the everyone's hearing how powerfully he had been cured through the virtues of Frideswide, beloved to God.

## 11. The leper healed by her kiss

^18^The most blessed virgin shone in these and other miracles in great numbers as the progression of days passed. The hour fell to the end of her worldly life, as common need pressed her on. And because God, the author of salvation, worked a multitude of such miracles through her, mortal weakness would hardly trust their writer. Having left more out completely, I judge that it is greatly unsuitable to keep one marvellous work of hers silent, completed by the incalculably great power of God. In truth, I think that it is no less astounding for her noble love and the firmness of her devotion than for the greatness of the miracle.

A day sorrowful to people but joyful to angels was at hand, on which Frideswide was to pass from her body. She led a horse to return to her own monastery. There, she finally gave back her final commendation to God where she first devoted herself to serve him in a religious habit.

When the consecrated virgin returned, the whole city rushed to meet her. And behold, among the crowd of clergy and people welcoming her, both men and women, there was a young man. Brutal leprosy deformed his entire body with pus and blisters, to such a degree that it almost seemed that he was not in a human form, except for his distinctive features. It was as if the craftsman had been cut off at the shape of a human body in the torso, before he could mark the distinctive consistency of limbs and senses with his masterful skill.^[cf. Virgil, *Aeneid* 8.442, 12.427] His sores and swellings and unfavourable colour so enveloped him that he might have been thought a monster rather than a man.

This man was not only assuredly wretched but fearsome beyond measure, when he approached the saint. He gave forth a sound as loud as he could with a hoarse voice in a manner inspiring fear and utterly bewildering, expressing words. He said, 'I entreat you, virgin Frideswide, through the omnipotent God, that you might give me a kiss in the name of Jesus Christ his only-begotten Son.'

What an entirely disagreeable utterance! What a truly disagreeable demand! Young leper, you ask to enjoy a virgin, royal by birth. But because she is the handmaid of Christ, not self-indulgent in her ways, you ask her to give you a kiss, into which the sterner seas shrink altogether in courage from fixing their gaze. Clearly your request, if great faith had not driven it to be brought forward, would perhaps have been thought to be presented by the unscrupulousness of madmen. Why not? People, as I have said, were unable to look on you because of dread; to touch you for the flowing pus; to approach you for the unbearable stench -- and you ask a kiss from a royal virgin? Be it so. Were you not a leper, yet a man, surely she could not offer you a kiss, who did not know manly touch from the beginning of her life?

But you say, 'This raging of an unendurable disease forces me to ask, and not of my sex, which you put on record. For I believe that at the touch of her most clean mouth the diseased uncleanness of my body will flee.'

What a thing to be marvelled at, unheard of in past ages! Inflamed with the fire of charity, the virgin immediately drew near, against the opinion of everyone. After she first marked him with the sign of the cross, she bestowed a kiss on the leper. For without doubt, what comes forth from true charity happens easily. Those watching shrunk back, and they looked for the result with great wonder. Clearly it was a miracle to be wondered at. So far as the symbolic washing of Naaman the Syrian seven times in the Jordan, according to the message of Elisha,^[see 2 Kings 5.1–20] points to the cleanness of the body, one devout kiss with the humble devoutness of a most holy girl bestowed no less for this man. For the mouth of the leper was touched with the mouth of the virgin, and immediately he was cleansed in his whole body. He cast off the roughness of his skin in the manner of scales, and he cast it off in the same way as a snake-like skin, and suddenly his flesh was like the flesh of a little boy. Who there did not become frightened at such a miracle? Who could restrain their mouth from Christ's praise? The city was filled with joy. Everyone rejoiced, all made merry, and they could not contain themselves in the coming of such a protector.

But the virgin was not elated with pride by these. Rather, the more she was increased in greater virtues, so much more humbly did she subdue her body and spirit.

## 12. How Sts Catherine and Cecilia were seen at her death, and light and fragrance poured forth

^19^When the day of her death was finally at hand, behold, an angel of the Lord stood near as she prayed, saying, 'On the fourteenth calends of November,^[19 October 727] in the very night that is closed by Sunday's dawn, God will determine the end of your struggle, Frideswide, and prepare your eternal reward. And because you have refused your father's earthly palace, you will enter the eternal king's house, where there is light everlasting, and life that knows no death.'

Saying this, he departed, and the heaviest fever seized Frideswide, from which she also began at once to be deprived of bodily strength. When it had become known to the citizens, they approached her as if their nurse and mother, asking advice for salvation with mournful sounds. She did not refuse a devout heart its desire, but with some effort she spread a word of salvation for common benefit every day of her sickness, as if against the law of nature. For charity gave what the deprivation of her strength denied.

^20^But when Saturday dawned, and the night now loomed near on which the virgin was to pass from her body, she said to those sitting with her, 'Dig a grave for me today in the church of the most blessed and ever-virgin Mary, the mother of my God and Lord Jesus Christ. Guarded by her protection, I may safely refuse the snares of evil spirits; safely come before the court of my same Lord, her Son. And because the solemn and customary memorial of his resurrection is celebrated tomorrow, and I will pass from the present age this night after the third cockcrow, I do not wish anyone to be worn out in digging for me in such a great and distinguished holy day.

She said this, and directed the Eucharist to be brought to her. Receiving it with thanksgiving, she blessed the Lord.

^21^And when she stretched her eyes to the heavens, and saw the virgins that she always venerated most coming to her from that place, in all the time since she lived among people on earth. And bending down humbly to those arriving, she called out with a joyful voice, 'Welcome, blessed virgins. "O how plentiful is your goodness, Lord, which you have laid up for them that fear you, and that you have prepared for them that hope in you!"^[Ps. 31.19 (Vulg. 30.20)] "Who will not fear you, O Lord, and glorify your name? For you alone are holy."'^[Rev. 15.4] Satan is accustomed to oppose victors and victresses returning to you from their camp, though he is defeated and ruined; and to apply the false accusations of his trickery. Lest your handmaid, about to pass to you, should fear his attack, you have guarded the traveller's paths with the stronghold in which you are known, and you have now given her blessed virgins to behold in her departure, whom you had given to love with reverence in life as if they were intimate. Indeed, I judge that this demonstrates that you fix it in the minds of your faithful to venerate certain servants and handmaids who have already left for you by the grace of their virtues; and in some to venerate others with particular honour before the rest.'

At the sound of her calling out, the sisters standing by were stirred up. They asked whom she was addressing.

She said to them, 'Do you not see the most holy virgins Catherine and Cecilia coming?' Turning to them afterwards, she said, 'Now I will come, my ladies; now I will come.'

And saying farewell to those standing near, she passed to the Lord at the hour which she had foretold. At the very hour of her death, a heavenly light was sent that suddenly lit up the dwelling place in which her most holy body lay. It thus filled the whole city with an incalculably fragrant odour following, that it might not be doubted that the only-begotten of the Father of lights was present, whose name, an ointment pouring forth, has filled the whole world.

## 13. How a certain paralytic and a cripple were healed at her funeral

^22^That it might not be doubtful that she lived after death, behold, a man afflicted with paralysis, having even lost the use of his tongue -- a very rich man. By his servants' hands, he was carried to the bier on which the most holy virgin's body rested. When he touched it, he was immediately made so strong that he burst forth with a great shout, leaping in praise of God and St Frideswide.

^23^And when that most chaste body was being carried to the grave with a great crowd of either order and sex, it happened that someone was so bound by a muscular disorder from the naval down that he was also deprived of the use of his feet. He stood with small supports, because he could not with his feet. Wretchedly dragging his body by the aid of his hands, he followed the virgin's funeral procession. But because he could not catch up with the most precious load's bier by walking, or go in once it had reached the church because of the crowd of people, he did what he could. With great shouts, he called out to her living, now to her dead, saying, 'O virgin of incalculable devoutness, O bride of mercy's fount, how long is it since I have wished to come to you? But a disorder has hindered me, a wretch with a bodily disorder, and painfully too of a sound mind. For I have deserved this for my sins, and it is not allowed for me to look at you either living or dead. But even so, my lady, turn your innermost pitying thoughts to me now, and cure me of this sickness. Indeed, I believe assuredly that this is most easy for you to do, because you have now deserved to reach him for whom nothing can be difficult.'

As he announced these things, he had turned the eyes of all those standing near onto himself. Behold, cracking violently, the contracture of his muscles was released, and the joints of his feet were made strong. And so, rising, the man immediately leapt up. Proclaiming himself free from pain with a rejoicing shout, he held up his supports in his hands. Forcing his way forward through the crowds, he rushed forth to the virgin's grave. There, he threw down his supports, and gave thanks to God and his glorious servant Frideswide. Then everyone's grief was turned into rejoicing, because while her burial rites were performed, they perceived that God was working miracles for his servant's virtues even after the course of her life.

^24^The blessed virgin was buried in the basilica of the chaste ever-virgin Mary, the mother of God, on the south side, near the the bank of the River Thames. For that was the basilica's position until the time of King Æthelred. After the burning of the Danes who fled there, [in 1002: see Æthelred's charter, translated in @whitelockEnglishHistoricalDocuments1979, pp. 590--593] he enlarged the basilica's extent, just as he had vowed before. It was doubtless done from this time, because the grave, which had once been to one side, thereafter formed part of the centre. [@blairFrideswideMonasteryProblems1988, pp. 246--247 discusses this arrangement] In that place, so many and great were the miracles that happened through her virtues, that people's faith could not absorb them, nor writers' attention gather them; through our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom is honour and dominion into the ages of ages. Amen.
