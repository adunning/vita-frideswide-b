# Here begins the prologue to the life of St Frideswide the virgin

[1] My most dear brethren, I have taken care to bring together everything into one book on the life and miracles of the most blessed virgin Frideswide, worthy of all veneration, which I have been able to learn in chronicles as well as in certain books of true histories or in catalogues of the saints of England.

It is clearly evident that, whoever that writer was of the life of that most holy virgin, he has avoided error in many things by far -- although some in their pride seem to think little of him. Dismissing a pen led in simplicity, they approve of a flower that cares more for its appearance than the usefulness of its fruit.

# Here begins the life

## The father and mother of St Frideswide; her birth and instruction

[2] Around the year 727 from the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ, the king of of all ages, when the word of God blossomed and brought forth the greatest fruit in the savage nation of the English -- which had seized the island of Britain, devastasted it, and put it under the control of its lordship with a bloodthirsty hand -- a certain vassal king named Didan, an orthodox man and outstanding in all the decency of his ways. He honoured a city with his frequent residence called Oxford in the Saxon tongue, which we can call *Boum Vadum* in Latin.

By divine will, he took a wife appropriate to his character named Safrida, from whom he received an heir, to his moral conduct rather than his spoils -- that is to say, an only daugher. He directed that she be called Frideswide when she was cleansed at the fount of holy baptism.

[3] After five years' attentive upbringing, they handed her over to learn the study of letters under the tuition of a very devout matron named Algiva.

As if the happiest foretelling of a happy future age, she shone forth in the very beginning of her study, so much that it was clear to everyone that the Holy Spirit had chosen her mind as his dwelling. For who was not astounded at a young girl, five years old, who had learnt the 150 psalms of David in roughly five months and committed them to memory? And a companion did not acquire jealousy for this reason from her, but touched by the zeal that filled her with charity, she offered herself as beloved by everyone. For she dutifully stored what she heard from the Scriptures in the bookcase of her chest, devoting herself persistently to return money loaned from the Lord to him *with interest*.^[Matt. 25.27]

Accordingly, she constantly slaughtered the sacrifice of her heart in a burnt offering acceptable to the Lord,^[Cf. Rom. 12.1, Phil. 4.18] in devout rivers of tears with sighs and groans day and night, praying continually that she *might deserve to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of her life*^[Ps. 27.4 (Vulg. 26.4)] and to contemplate his face.

## The death of her mother; her advancement into a holy manner of life and the construction of her monastery by her father; how she became a nun; and the death of her father

[4] As an adult, she had not entrusted herself to a husband when her mother passed from the earth.

Lacking any other source of comfort, the virgin was released from her father's protection. As much as she could, she urged him with sound warnings to seek remedies for his soul, as he was about to go in a short time from this place to where the companion of his bed had gone before. Sorrow at the the recent loss of his wife laid him low, as is usual. Urged by the constant prayers of his most beloved daughter, he built a church within the compass of the city's walls. It was dedicated in honour of the holy and everlasting Trinity and the ever-virgin Mary, the mother of God, and of all the saints. He entrusted it to his daughter at her request.

She entered the church and handed herself over intentionally to divine works, entrusting her chastity to the Lord with persistent prayers. She opened her innermost thoughts in her entreaties, giving gifts to the poor with her own hand when they asked. She also neglected the splendour of the world to desire the celestial country ardently. She seemed nearly to have shed the burden of her flesh, and to have put on the armour of immortality.^[Cf. Rom. 13.14; Eph. 6.11] For she did not feed the body with food but she enlarged her spirit. She did not dress in soft clothing,^[Cf. Matt. 11.8; Luke 7.25] but kept vigil with the sharpest hair shirts. She did not sleep on softness, but pricked herself if she slept. What can I say of her bed, since it was nothing but the hardest ground? She laid down on it when sleep conquered her, settling her debt to nature; bowing down to the ground, she constantly sought it on her knees when she poured out prayers to the Lord. You would be amazed that the royal daughter raised on kingly feasts faught the wantonness of hunger with a rough meal of cheap vegetables and a small portion of barley bread; and that she overcame the urgent burning licentiousness of thirst with a mouthful of water. What more? She so embarked on *the narrow and hard way that leads to life*^[Matt. 7.14] that there was nothing further.

O unhappy people of this time, *whose god is their belly, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things,*^[Phil. 3.19] who put piety forward with their habit, but gainsay it with their conduct and life! They turn their eyes onto themselves with the cheap garment of appearance, but they disrupt their bowels in overindulgence of fine food. If they ever fast, they 'search earth and sea'^[Lucan, *Pharsalia* 5.262] whence they might compensate for the loss of fasting. But this is not the *fast that I choose*,^[Is. 58.5-6] says the Lord.

England was amazed, everyone wondered, perceiving that the weak sex was surpassing manly strength at a tender age. But the happy young girl's father was brought to dance with joy, because he had thought that his heir would provide a leader of earthly affairs, but now he looked to heavenly desire.

[5] And what is more, to demonstrate that she had fully put off every hope of a perishable future age, she asked her father that she might deserve to receive the habit of nuns. With a wise plan, she was taking precautions, without doubt, that she should not by chance be forced to enter a marriage after her father's death, and to corrupt her intention to remain a virgin  in every respect. Besides, the most blessed virgin was sick of adorning her body in purple: she had known that she was redeemed by the blood of Christ while she was condemned by faithless, foul death. Betrothing herself with the ring of faith, she despised gold and precious stones as merchandise of little worth.

King Didan, rejoicing greatly at his daughter's plan, ordered the bishop of the diocese to be summoned near and asked for the habit of nuns to be given to his most beloved daughter. Advancing in emulation of the most blessed virgin, roughly twelve girls of noble birth left everything and followed the Lord, *walking in all his commandments and precepts*^[Luke 1.6] following the example of Frideswide, beloved of God. Although they could not equal her in virtues, they still glowed to be made her partners by sharing in the kingdom of heaven. And so, by the king's generosity, they built apartments for themselves, most fit for holiness, alongside a church. There, melodious happiness echoed day and night in the mind of the virgins with a harmonious voice, singing psalms and hymns.

[6] Meanwhile, the king himself sunk to his bed, struck by a very heavy fever; and brought to the last, strengthened by the viaticum of the body of Christ, he slept with his fathers, finishing his days in good old age.

## How she increased day by day in virtues after the death of father; and how the devil, defeated, departed from her

Blessed Frideswide was thus deprived of the comfort of both her parents. She desired the 'Father who is in heaven'^[Matt. 6.9] ardently; she hurried to him with whatever steps she could. For she extended her fasts, she persevered in continual prayer, and furthermore she sought the one her soul loved a hundred times a day and a hundred times every night on bended knees.

[7] But who can prevail in one's attempts to be good in the world without someone who is particularly harmful becoming jealous? For he who was able to drive away the first person from the joys of paradise attempts to cast down everyone. And because he could not overthrow Frideswide's mind with the goad of temptation, he displayed a physical spectacle for her bodily eyes to fight with her hand-to-hand.

And he was puffed up into the hope of his ancient madness, in which he was declaring that he would be like the Highest, and disguised himself as Christ. And, accompanied by a band of demons disguised as angels of light, he approached the virgin with these words: 'Come, my beloved, come; because it is time for you to gain the crown of glory that cannot fade, which you have deserved. Come and prostrate yourself at the soles of my feet; worship him whom you have long desired. For I wish to appear to you for this: that you may see me for whom you have sighed with such passionate desire, and that you may succeed in entering the reward of eternal life without the trouble of the body.'

The virgin, informed by the Holy Spirit -- by whose inspiration to the human race she discovered this enemy -- began thus: 'Why, most miserable creature, do you presume to promise to others what you do not have, nor can have because of your pride? What is immortal life to you? You died while living, and you sink always into eternal death while remaining in existence. But I, a wretched and most miserable sinner, would have shared in your damnation if the mercy of my redeemer Christ  -- whom you most wickedly pretend to be -- had not come before. For he is 'my hope, even from my youth'.^[Ps. 71.5]

At the virgin's lowly words, that proud one disappeared, not enduring the Spirit. He filled the air with horrible howling and a deadly stench. Blessed Frideswide continued in prayer and remained in vigils with a calm mind, and remained undaunted.

## The blinded messengers of King Algar, and their restoration to health by her prayers

[8] But the deviser of unrighteousness did not rest from the assault of his craft, even though he had gone away conquered and confused. For he drew near King Algar, who was more than wicked enough. He touched the man with unchaste love for the virgin Frideswide, inflamed him with passion. To cast her down from her monastic habit, he suggested that it was not sinful or wicked to summon the daughter of a king (though a nun) with threats to a royal bed. Rather, it was to have the best child, and to bring him up to the hope of a kingdom, that he might lead a lazy life filled with carelessness.<!-- chk -->

With these spurs of suggestion, the raging king, set in motion, rushed forth as if madly excited. He ordered his messengers to speed forth who might bring forward Frideswide with the greatest haste and force her to hasten whether she refused or desired it.

The wicked messengers of the most wicked king fled without delay. They quickly crossed through the space of many lands. Standing in Frideswide's presence, they drew near to accost her with these words: 'King Algar', they said, 'sent us to you, O Frideswide, for the purpose of a future errand to you. But use wise judgement and agree to the king's will -- the honour of accepting. For your opposition will not be without punishment. The king desires you for his bed most intensely, and to join you in the chain of marriage, and to make you a sharer of the kingdom.'

The virgin answered them with a most humble mind, as it always was, with an unassuming voice: 'If I had been inclined to unite with a man in marriage, I would never have the power to refuse the request of King Algar. Now, because I am betrothed to Christ, the king of immortality, I judge it truly wicked that I should refuse him and offer assent with that man in mortal death. Looking down on the fruit of immortality, I would seek a mortal descendant with the loss of chastity.'

They said, 'This trick will not help you; because if you refuse to agree and obey the king's will in order to honour the nobility of your desire, you will suffer many wrongs to your chastity, dragged to a brothel. Unwilling, you will be made a plaything for bawds. Shamefully spoiled and repudiated, you will thus finally be taught that a sound mind does not pollute royal honour of this kind.'

At this, the virgin replied, 'Your threats would be utterly to be feared, if it were not that the Lord has the power to hold back the hands of the ungodly, so that they cannot accomplish the works that they put forward to undertake in their wicked mind. Moreover, the body cannot be polluted by any contagion of defilement except by the consent of the mind. And assuredly, the wholeness of a body that corruption of the mind has polluted is not pleasing to God. It is even so if the violence of unchaste people should trouble the cloisters of the seal of chastity. When free will opposes it, it is rightly restored with an incorrupt mind to the reward of its wholeness by God the examiner.

[9] At the girl's answers, it was as if the agents of wickedness were dazed by the sight of the noonday sun. Still, they continued in the stubbornness of their madness. Since they did not know what they might disagree with her further in their shock at her great constancy, they prepared to reply by force.

But Frideswide, fleeing for refuge to God her defender, poured forth prayers with tears on high, shouting with a great voice and waying, '*Arise, Lord, let not man take comfort; let the nations be judged in your sight, and let them know that they are but men.*^[Ps. 9.19–20 (Vulg. 9.20–21)] *Take hold of shield and buckler and arise for my help. Say to my soul, "I am your salvation."*^[Ps. 35.2–3 (Vulg. 34.2–3)] *O the depth of your wisdom, Lord God, how unsearchable are your judgements and how inscrutable your ways!*^[Rom. 11.13] Truly *nobody has trusted in you and been forsaken.*'^[Sirach 2.11–12]

Behold the *wicked men*^[Gen. 13.13] who do not wish to hear the voice of your handmaid, that they may do good. Having first lost their eyesight, they were forced unwillingly to cease from their wrongful deeds. They learned by experience what they had failed to pay attention to when they were taught salvation.

The city was filled with the miracle's strength without delay. They gathered from everywhere. Everyone wondered and was afraid. Falling forward at the virgin's feet, they asked humbly for compassion on the blind men, that she would not consider the crimes of the foolish and therefore most miserable men, but be favourably inclined to think it fit to pray for them -- and that the pious woman might restore the light by her prayer where the wretches had been deprived of it by their own obstinacy.

[10] But the vessel of devoutness did not endure long torturing of the wicked men, or the people's sobbing in their request. She was turned to prayers; she entreated God on her knees. 'Invisible and unchangeable God', she said, 'the creator of all creatures, at whose will things are made that are not, at whose wish all things remain, who shaped humanity anew, sinning by their own guilt, to life: restore the light to these most wretched men, what this people may know that you are *full of compassion and mercy, long-suffering and of great goodness and truth,*^[Ps. 86.16 (Vulg. 85.15)] *rewarding each according to his work,*^[Ps. 62.12 (Vulg. 61.13)] who lives and reigns through the ages of ages.'

At the blessed virgin's voice, when everyone standing round answered, 'Amen', the light was restored to the wretches. But they threw themselves down at her feet, profitably pricked at heart, demanding her forgiveness of their crime.

She said to them, 'Do not suppose that this happened by my virtues, but by the Saviour's mercy, and by the faith of the people themselves praying. Remember these things that you have endured, and from now on, do not trouble the handmaids of Christ.

## How she dealt with the madness of King Algar, informed by an angel

[11] And so, the men returned and reported to the king what had happened in order.

But he said, 'By no means shall her charms or deceptive dogmas or magic art snatch her from my hands. But because she has dared to disdain me: after I have ravaged her at my pleasure, she will indeed be handed over to be defiled by the abuse of bawds.'

He said these things and called for horses with precipitous haste, driven by rage, and he embarked on the journey to the city where the virgin dwelled, urged on by a wicked desire.

O how great is the multitude of your mercies, Lord, who does not forsake those who hope in you.^[cf. section 9, above, and Sirach 2.11–12] In the very night, while Frideswide, unaware of these things, was intent on prayer in her usual custom, your holy angel stood by her, saying, 'Are you unaware, O virgin, that the most wicked King Algar will be at the gates of the city tomorrow to indulge his lust, if he is given the possibility of intruding into the chasity of your virginity?'

Heading these things, the holy woman *became immensely frightened,*^[1 Macc. 16.22] and not so much from such a sudden angelic vision as from the hastening of savage wickedness. She stood dazed, not knowing what to do.

The angel said to her, 'Do not fear, Frideswide: the Lord Jesus Christ will guard the pleasant dwelling-place which you have made ready for him in your virginity. The deluded^[DMLBS, s.v. 'illudere 3': 'with reference to dreams'; 'with reference to nocturnal emission of semen'.] king will turn back, disappointed by the hope of his malice, and the punishment of everlasting blindness will destroy it. But now, hurry, and follow the path that leads to the River Thames with whichever of your companions you wish. You will find a light boat prepared by God, and in it a sailor to guide the way.' He said these things, and suddenly dissappeared from the virgin's view.

[12] Frideswide gave thanks to God and arose happy from prayer. Taking two of her sisters with her, she reached the Thames, and according to the angel's word, found a little boat alongside the river. They stepped into it and saw a youth sitting to one side, with shining garb and a most pleasing countenance. He soothed them with his sweet speech and settled them in the little boat. A miraculous thing: a miraculous onrush of power. In the space of an hour they were carried across ten miles, and they put ashore close to the village called Bampton.

But when they put ashore, they saw neither the boat nor their journey's guide anywhere.

## The blinding of King Algar, and why kings do not go into Oxford



## The girl healed through a drop of liquid falling from Frideswide's hands



## How she lived in the settlement called Binsey, and obtained a well by prayer

[15] But the 'virgin most wise'^[Magnificat antiphon used for various Marian feasts.] did not endure 



Therefore, she called together the companions of her isolation and said, 'I judge that it is now the right time for us to approach our own monastery. For our sisters might perhaps, God forbid, have refrained from their good way of life, either in being typically anxious for us, or falling down a deep pit in sadness at our absence.'

Thus she spoke, and went aboard the readied ship with her sisters. By the work of sailing, it was brought vigorously, running fleetly, to the settlement near the city called Binsey.

She disembarked from the ship to see clearly, considering the place. She considered that it would usefully be a short distance from the city, and devoting herself to beloved tranquillity. It would not be burdensome for the virgins whom she had left in the monastery to come; and it would be less suited to the inhabitants, always seeking something to wonder at for its newness.

In the aforementioned settlement, there was a place planed with trees of many different kinds. It was called Thornbury in the Saxon tongue for the great number of different kinds of brambles -- isolated indeed and most suited to devotion. She built a chapel in it at once, and a great many buildings suited to the use of holy people. And because the riverbed was far away, and it seemed inappropriate to her that the sisters should go there to drink, she obtained a well by prayer. It is there to this day, providing the free gift of health to many who drink from it.

She was hoping to hide here, to devote herself to beloved tranquillity and avoid the crowds of people.

[22]

[24] The blessed virgin was buried in the basilica of the chaste ever-virgin Mary, the mother of God, on the south side, near the the bank of the River Thames. For that was the basilica's position until the time of King Æthelred. After the burning of the Danes who fled there, [In 1002: @blair:1988frideswides, p. 000<!--give ref-->; see Æthelred's charter, translated in @whitelock:1979english, pp. 590--593] he enlarged the basilica's extent, just as he had vowed before. It was doubtless done from this time, because the tomb, which had once been to one side, thereafter formed part of the centre. [@blair:1988frideswides, p. 247<!-- chk range --> discusses this arrangement] In that place, so many and great were the miracles that happened through her virtues, that people's faith could not absorb them, nor writers' attention gather them; through our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom is honour and dominion into the ages of ages. Amen.
