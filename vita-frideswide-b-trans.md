# Here begins the prologue to the life of St Frideswide the virgin

[1] My most dear brethren, I have taken care to bring together everything into one book on the life and miracles of the most blessed virgin Frideswide, worthy of all veneration, which I have been able to learn in chronicles as well as in certain books of true histories or in catalogues of the saints of England.

It is clearly evident that, whoever that writer was of the life of that most holy virgin, he has avoided error in many things by far -- although some in their pride seem to think little of him. Dismissing a pen led in simplicity, they approve of a flower that cares more for its appearance than the usefulness of its fruit.

# Here begins the life

## The father and mother of St Frideswide; her birth and instruction

[2] Around the year 727 from the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ, the king of of all ages, when the word of God blossomed and brought forth the greatest fruit in the savage nation of the English -- which had seized the island of Britain, devastasted it, and put it under the control of its lordship with a bloodthirsty hand -- a certain vassal king named Didan, an orthodox man and superb in all his way of life<!-- chk -->. He honoured a city with his frequent residence called Oxford in the Saxon tongue, which we can call 'the ford of oxen' in Latin.<!-- chk -->

By divine will, he took a wife appropriate to his character named Safrida, from whom he received an heir, to his moral conduct rather than his spoils -- that is to say, an only daugher. He directed that she be called Frideswide when she was cleansed at the fount of holy baptism.

[3] After five years' attentive upbringing, they handed her over to learn the study of letters under the tuition of a very devout matron named Algiva.

As if the happiest foretelling of a happy future age, she shone forth in the very beginning of her study, so much that it was clear to everyone that the Holy Spirit had chosen her mind as his dwelling. For who was not astounded at a young girl, five years old, who had learnt the 150 psalms of David in roughly five months and committed them to memory? And a companion did not acquire jealousy for this reason from her, but touched by the zeal that filled her with charity, she offered herself as beloved by everyone. For she dutifully stored what she heard from the Scriptures in the bookcase of her chest, devoting herself persistently to return money loaned from the Lord to him *with interest*.^[Matt. 25.27]

Accordingly, she constantly slaughtered the sacrifice of her heart in a burnt offering acceptable to the Lord,^[Cf. Rom. 12.1, Phil. 4.18] in devout rivers of tears with sighs and groans day and night, praying continually that she *might deserve to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of her life*^[Ps. 27.4 (Vulg. 26.4)] and to contemplate his face.

## The death of her mother; her advancement into a holy manner of life and the construction of her monastery by her father; how she became a nun; and the death of her father

[4] As an adult, she had not sealed herself to her own man<!-- chk --> when her mother passed from the earth. 

Therefore, lacking any other source of comfort, the virgin was released from her father's protection. As long as she could, she drove him with sound warnings that he should not hesitate to seek a cure for his soul, about to go from this point in a brief marriage in which he had excelled.<!-- chk -->

Sorrow at the the recent loss of his wife laid him low, as is usual. Urged by the constant prayers of his most beloved daughter, he built a church within the compass of the city's walls. It was dedicated in honour of the holy and everlasting Trinity and the ever-virgin Mary, the mother of God, and of all the saints. He entrusted it to his daughter at her request.

She entered the church and handed herself over intentionally to divine works, entrusting her chastity to the Lord with persistent prayers. She opened her innermost thoughts in her entreaties, giving gifts to the poor with her own hand when they asked. She also neglected the splendour of the world to desire the celestial country ardently. She seemed nearly to have shed the burden of her flesh, and to have put on the armour of immortality.^[Cf. Rom. 13.14; Eph. 6.11] For she did not feed the body with food but she enlarged her spirit. She did not dress in soft clothing,^[Cf. Matt. 11.8; Luke 7.25] but kept vigil with the sharpest hair shirts. She did not sleep on softness, but pricked herself if she slept. What can I say of her bed, since it was nothing but the hardest ground? She laid down on it when sleep conquered her, settling her debt to nature; bowing down to the ground, she constantly sought it on her knees when she poured out prayers to the Lord. You would be amazed that the royal daughter raised on kingly feasts faught the wantonness of hunger with a rough meal of cheap vegetables and a small portion of barley bread; and that she overcame the urgent burning licentiousness of thirst with a mouthful of water. What more? She so embarked on *the narrow and hard way that leads to life*^[Matt. 7.14] that there was nothing further.

O unhappy people of this time, *whose god is their belly, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things,*^[Phil. 3.19] who put piety forward with their habit, but gainsay it with their conduct and life! They turn their eyes onto themselves with the cheap garment of appearance, but they disrupt their bowels in overindulgence of fine food. If they ever fast, they 'search earth and sea'^[Lucan, *Pharsalia* 5.262] from where they might compensate for the loss of fasting. But this is not the *fast that I choose*,^[Is. 58.5-6] says the Lord.

England was amazed, everyone wondered, perceiving that the weak sex at a tender age was surpassing manly strength. But the happy young girl's father was brought to dance with joy, because he had thought that his heir would provide a leader of earthly affairs, but now he looked to heavenly desire.

[5] And what is more, to demonstrate that she had fully put off every hope of a perishable future age, she asked her father that she might deserve to receive the habit of nuns.

## The girl healed through a drop of liquid falling from Frideswide's hands



## How she lived in the settlement called Binsey, and obtained a well by prayer

[15] But the 'virgin most wise'^[Magnificat antiphon used for various Marian feasts.] did not endure 



Therefore, she called together the companions of her isolation and said, 'I judge that it is now the right time for us to approach our own monastery. For our sisters might perhaps, God forbid, have refrained from their good way of life, either in being typically anxious for us, or falling down a deep pit in sadness at our absence.'

Thus she spoke, and went aboard the readied ship with her sisters. By the work of sailing, it was brought vigorously, running fleetly, to the settlement near the city called Binsey.

She disembarked from the ship to see clearly, considering the place. She considered that it would usefully be a short distance from the city, and devoting herself to beloved tranquillity. It would not be burdensome for the virgins whom she had left in the monastery to come; and it would be less suited to the inhabitants, always seeking something to wonder at for its newness.

In the aforementioned settlement, there was a place planed with trees of many different kinds. It was called Thornbury in the Saxon tongue for the great number of different kinds of brambles -- isolated indeed and most suited to devotion. She built a chapel in it at once, and a great many buildings suited to the use of holy people. And because the riverbed was far away, and it seemed inappropriate to her that the sisters should go there to drink, she obtained a well by prayer. It is there to this day, providing the free gift of health to many who drink from it.

She was hoping to hide here, to devote herself to beloved tranquillity and avoid the crowds of people.

[22]

[24] The blessed virgin was buried in the basilica of the chaste ever-virgin Mary, the mother of God, on the south side, near the the bank of the River Thames. For that was the basilica's position until the time of King Æthelred. After the burning of the Danes who fled there, [In 1002: @blair:1988frideswides, p. 000<!--give ref-->; see Æthelred's charter, translated in @whitelock:1979english, pp. 590--593] he enlarged the basilica's extent, just as he had vowed before. It was doubtless done from this time, because the tomb, which had once been to one side, thereafter formed part of the centre. [@blair:1988frideswides, p. 247<!-- chk range --> discusses this arrangement] In that place, so many and great were the miracles that happened through her virtues, that people's faith could not absorb them, nor writers' attention gather them; through our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom is honour and dominion into the ages of ages. Amen.
